# Testing Demo

This is a simple fullstack project (ExpressJS and React) with the purpose of learning about linters and unit tests. 

The first task is to apply eslint to both client and server and fix all warnings and errors.

The second task is to write basic tests for both client and server.

The third task is to add functionality (like more data to messages, verifying the input, etc.) and update all tests.
